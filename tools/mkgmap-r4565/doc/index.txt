Background
==========
The mkgmap program is distributed in Java archive format compiled for use under
the Java Runtime Environment 8. You will need the Java SE Runtime Environment 8
installed on your system in order to run mkgmap.

Garmin maps consist of a series of .img files, with each file containing the data
for one tile of the map. Unless you intend to build a very small map, you will
need to use the accompanying splitter program to split your map into smaller
tiles. The individual tiles can be joined together to produce a single
gmapsupp.img file which contains the whole map and can be copied into the /Garmin
folder of an SD card for use by a GPS device. If you want to create more than one
map for use on your GPS, the gmapsupp.img files can be renamed to be unique, for
example gmapsupp1.img, gmapsupp2.img.

A typical simple example using both splitter and mkgmap:

java.exe -Xmx2g -jar splitter.jar england-latest.o5m

    java.exe -jar mkgmap.jar --gmapsupp -c template.args

The first command splits the Open Street Map data into smaller files with each
file containing the data for one tile of the map. It also produces a file named
template.args that contains the names of all the generated files.

The second command takes as input all the individual files listed in the
template.args file generated by splitter, produces a .img file for each tile,
then merges all the tiles together into a single gmapsupp.img file.
