List of options Note that option order is significant: An option only
=====================================================================
applies to subsequent input files. (So if you are using splitter, you probably
want to put most of your options before '-c template.args'.)

General options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--help=topic
    Print help on the given topic. If the topic is omitted then a list of all the
    help topics is printed instead.

--version
    Output program version to stderr.

File options
~~~~~~~~~~~~

--input-file=filename
    Read input data from the give file. This option (or just a filename) may be
    given more than once.

--gmapsupp
    Create a gmapsupp.img file that can be uploaded to a Garmin or placed in
    "/Garmin" in a microSD card (such as by mounting the device in USB mass
    storage mode). It can be used on ready compiled img files, if the input files
    are not already compiled then they are compiled first and then the gmapsupp
    is created.

-c filename
--read-config=filename
    The given file is opened and each line is an option setting of the form
    option=value, any option that could be used on the command line can be used,
    however you omit the leading '--'. The short option names with a single '-'
    cannot be used, simply use the long name instead.

--output-dir=filename
    The directory in which all output files are written. It defaults to the
    current working directory, i.e. the directory the command is executed from.

-n name
--mapname=name
    Set the name of the map. Garmin maps are named by 8 digit numbersList. The
    default is 63240001. It is best to use a different name if you are going to
    be making a map for others to use so that it is unique and does not clash
    with others.

--description=text
    Sets the descriptive text for the map. This may be displayed in QLandkarte,
    MapSource or on a GPS, where it is normally shown below the family name.
    Example: --description="Germany, Denmark" Please note: if you use
    splitter.jar to build a template.args file and use -c template.args, then
    that file may contain a "description" that will override this option. Use
    "--description" in splitter.jar to change the description in the
    template.args file.

--country-name=name
    Sets the map's country name. The default is "COUNTRY".

--country-abbr=abbreviation
    Sets the map's abbreviated country name. The default is "ABC".

--region-name=name
    Sets the map's region name. By default, the map has no region name.

--region-abbr=abbreviation
    Sets the map's abbreviated region name. By default, the map has no
    abbreviated region name.

Label options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--latin1
    This is equivalent to --code-page=1252.

--unicode
    This is equivalent to --code-page=65001. Note that only newer devices support
    Unicode.

--code-page=number
    This option enables the use of international characters. Only 8 bit character
    sets are supported and so you have to specify which code page you want to
    use.
    It is entirely dependent on the device firmware which code pages are
    supported.

--charset=name
    This option is obsolete. Change the character set with the --code-page
    option.

--lower-case
    Allow labels to contain lower case letters. Note that most or all Garmin
    devices are not able to display lower case letters at an angle so this option
    is not generally useful.

Address search options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--index
    Generate a global address search index. If the --gmapsupp option is also
    given, then the index is generated within the resulting gmapsupp.img file so
    that address search will work on a GPS device.
    If instead the --tdbfile option is given then the index consists of two files
    named osmmap.mdx and osmmap_mdr.img which can be used with mapsource. (For
    compatibility, you do not need the tdbfile option if gmapsupp is not given).
    If both the --gmapsupp and --tdbfile options are given alongside the --index
    option, then both indexes will be created. Note that this will require
    roughly twice as much memory.
    The --overview-mapname option can be used to change these names. If the
    mapset is sent to the device from MapSource, it will enable find by name and
    address search on the GPS.

    The address fields are assigned by special mkgmap address tags using the
    style file:
     mkgmap:country
     mkgmap:region
     mkgmap:city
     mkgmap:postal_code
     mkgmap:street
     mkgmap:housenumber
     mkgmap:phone
     (mkgmap:is_in - used by location-autofill=is_in)

    If the index is created from previously compiled .img files, then the same
    code page and sorting options (e.g. --code-page, --latin1) must be used as
    were used to compile the individual map tiles.

--x-split-name-index
    A temporary option to enable indexing each part of a street name separately.
    So for example if the street is "Aleksandra Gryglewskiego" then you will be
    able to search for it as both "Aleksandra" and "Gryglewskiego". It will also
    increase the size of the index. Useful in countries where searching for the
    first word in name is not the right thing to do.
    Note that this option is still experimental and there may be problems. If you
    find any let us know!

--bounds=directory|zipfile
    A directory or a zip file containing the preprocessed bounds files. Bounds
    files in a zip file must be located in the zip file's root directory.
    The preprocessed boundaries are used to add special tags to all elements
    (points, lines and polygons) containing the elements location information.
    The style file can be used to assign the address tags mkgmap:country,
    mkgmap:region etc. using these values.
    The following special tags are added:
    
      mkgmap:admin_level2 : Name of the admin_level=2 boundary 
      mkgmap:admin_level3 : Name of the admin_level=3 boundary
      ..
      mkgmap:admin_level11
      mkgmap:postcode : the postal_code value

    Preprocessed bounds can be created with the following command:
    
       java -cp mkgmap.jar 
          uk.me.parabola.mkgmap.reader.osm.boundary.BoundaryPreprocessor
          <inputfile> <boundsdir>

    The input file must contain the boundaries that should be preprocessed. It
    can have OSM, PBF or O5M file format. It is recommended that it contains the
    boundary data only to avoid very high memory usage. The boundsdir gives the
    directory where the processed files are stored. This directory can be used as
    --bounds parameter with mkgmap.

--location-autofill=[option1,[option2]]
    Controls how the address fields for country, region, city and zip info are
    gathered automatically if the fields are not set by using the special mkgmap
    address tags (e.g. mkgmap:city - see option index). Warning: automatic
    assignment of address fields is somehow a best guess.

    is_in
        The is_in tag is analyzed for country and region information.

    nearest
        The city/hamlet points that are closest to the element are used to assign
        the missing address fields. Beware that cities located in the same tile
        are used only. So the results close to a tile border have less quality.

--housenumbers
    Enables house number search for OSM input files. All nodes and polygons
    having addr:housenumber set are matched to streets. A match between a house
    number element and a street is created if the street is located within a
    radius of 150m and the addr:street tag value of the house number element
    equals the mgkmap:street tag value of the street. The mkgmap:street tag must
    be added to the street in the style file. For optimal results, the tags
    mkgmap:city and mkgmap:postal_code should be set for the housenumber element.
    If a street connects two or more cities this allows to find all addresses
    along the road, even they have the same number.

    Example for given street name:

    Node - addr:street=Main Street addr:housenumber=2

        Way 1 - name=Main Street

        Way 2 - name=Main Street, mkgmap:street=Main Street

        Way 3 - mkgmap:street=Mainstreet

        Way 4 - name=Main Street [A504]

    The node matches to Way 2. It has mkgmap:street set with a value equal to the
    addr:street tag value of the house number node.
    If the street is not given with addr:housenumber, mkgmap uses heuristics to
    find the best match.

Overview map options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--overview-mapname=name
    If --tdbfile is enabled, this gives the name of the overview .img and .tdb
    files. The default map name is osmmap.

--overview-mapnumber=8 digit number
    If --tdbfile is enabled, this gives the internal 8 digit number used in the
    overview map and tdb file. The default number is 63240000.

--overview-levels
    like levels, specifies additional levels that are to be written to the
    overview map. Counting of the levels should continue. Up to 8 additional
    levels may be specified, but the lowest usable resolution with MapSource
    seems to be 11. The hard coded default is empty.

--remove-ovm-work-files
    If overview-levels is used, mkgmap creates one additional file with the
    prefix ovm_ for each map (*.img) file. These files are used to create the
    overview map. With option --remove-ovm-work-files=true the files are removed
    after the overview map was created. The default is to keep the files.

Style options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--style-file=file
    Specify an external file to obtain the style from. "file" can be a directory
    containing files such as info, lines, options (see resources/styles/default
    for an example). The directory path must be absolute or relative to the
    current working directory when mkgmap is invoked.
    The file can be a zip file containing the files instead of a directory.
    The files can be at the top level or contained in a folder within the zip
    file. If the zip file contains more than one top level folder then each
    folder is the name of a style that can be selected with the --style option.
    The argument can also be a URL that specifies the location of a style file.

--style=name
    Specify a style name. Must be used if --style-file points to a directory or
    zip file containing multiple styles. If --style-file is not used, it selects
    one of the built-in styles.

--list-styles
    List the available styles. If this option is preceded by a style-file option
    then it lists the styles available within that file.

--check-styles
    Perform some checks on the available styles. If this option is preceded by a
    style-file option then it checks the styles available within that file. If it
    is also preceded by the style option it will only check that style.

--levels=levels code
    Change the way that the levels on the map correspond to the zoom levels in
    the device. See customisation help. The default is: "0:24, 1:22, 2:20, 3:18,
    4:16", although each style can have its own default. Up to 8 levels may be
    specified.

--name-tag-list
    Get the tag that will be used to supply the name. Useful for language
    variations. You can supply a list and the first one will be used. e.g.
    --name-tag-list=name:en,int_name,name

--map-features=file
    This option is ignored; use the --style-file option instead.

Product description options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--family-id
    This is an integer that identifies a family of products. Range: [1..9999]
    Mkgmap default: 6324

--family-name
    If you build several maps, this option describes the family name of all of
    your maps. Garmin will display this in the map selection screen.
    Example: --family-name="OpenStreetmap mkgmap XL 2019"

--product-id
    This is an integer that identifies a product within a family. It is often
    just 1, which is the default.

--product-version
    The version of the product. Default value is 1.

--series-name
    This name will be displayed in MapSource in the map selection drop-down. The
    default is "OSM map".

--area-name
    Area name is displayed on Garmin units (or at least on eTrex) as the second
    part of the mapname in the list of the individual maps.

--copyright-message=note
    Specify a copyright message for files that do not contain one.

--copyright-file=file
    Specify copyright messages from a file. Note that the first copyright message
    is not displayed on a device, but is shown in BaseCamp. The copyright file
    must include at least two lines.

--license-file=file
    Specify a file which content will be added as license. All entries of all
    maps will be merged in the overview map.

Optimization options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--reduce-point-density=NUM
    Simplifies the ways with the Douglas Peucker algorithm. NUM is the maximal
    allowed error distance, by which the resulting way may differ from the
    original one. This distance gets shifted with lower zoom levels. Recommended
    setting is 4, this should lead to only small differences (Default is 2.6,
    which should lead to invisible changes)

--reduce-point-density-polygon=NUM
    Allows to set the maximal allowed error distance for the DP algorithm to be
    applied against polygons. Recommended setting is 8.

--merge-lines
    Try to merge lines. This helps the simplify filter to straighten out longer
    chunks at lower zoom levels. Decreases file size more. Increases paint speed
    at low zoom levels. Default is enabled, use --no-merge-lines to disable.

--min-size-polygon=NUM
    Removes all polygons smaller than NUM from the map. This reduces map size and
    speeds up redrawing of maps. Recommended value is 8 to 15, default is 8. See
    also polygon-size-limits.

--polygon-size-limits=limits code
    Allows to specify different min-size-polygon values for each resolution.
    Sample: --polygon-size-limits="24:12, 18:10, 16:8, 14:4, 12:2, 11:0" If a
    resolution is not given, mkgmap uses the value for the next higher one. For
    the given sample, resolutions 19 to 24 will use value 12, resolution 17 and
    18 will use 10, and so on. Value 0 means to skip the size filter. Note that
    in resolution 24 the filter is not used.

Miscellaneous options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--max-jobs[=number]
    When number is specified, allow that number of maps to be processed
    concurrently. If number is not specified, the limit is set equal to the
    number of CPU cores. If this option is not given at all, the limit is 1
    (i.e., the maps are processed sequentially).

--keep-going
    Don't quit whole application if an exception occurs while processing a map -
    continue to process the other maps.

--block-size=number
    Changes the block size that is used in the generated map. This option is not
    usually needed, but sometimes an error message will ask you to try a value
    for this option.

--net
    Obsolete, use --route instead.

--route
    Create maps that support routing.

--drive-on=left|right|detect|detect,left|detect,right
    Explicitly specify which side of the road vehicles are expected to drive on.
    If the first option is detect, the program tries to find out the proper flag.
    If that detection fails, the second value is used (or right if none is
    given). With OSM data as input, the detection tries to find out the country
    each road is in and compares the number of drive-on-left roads with the rest.
    Use the --bounds option to make sure that the detection finds the correct
    country.

--drive-on-left
--drive-on-right
    Deprecated: Use drive-on instead. The options are translated to
    drive-on=left|right.

--check-roundabouts
    Check that roundabouts have the expected direction (clockwise when vehicles
    drive on the left). Roundabouts that are complete loops and have the wrong
    direction are reversed. Also checks that the roundabouts do not fork or
    overlap other roundabouts.

--check-roundabout-flares
    Sanity check roundabout flare roads - warn if they don't point in the correct
    direction or if they are not one-way or if they extend too far.

--max-flare-length-ratio=NUM
    When checking flare roads, ignore roads whose length is greater than NUM (an
    integer) times the distance between the nodes on the roundabout that the
    flare roads connect to. Using this option with a value of at least 5 will cut
    down the number of legitimate roads that are flagged as flare road problems.
    Default value is 0 (disabled) because it's not a completely reliable
    heuristic.

--ignore-maxspeeds
    Now ignored, former usage: When reading OSM files, ignore any "maxspeed"
    tags.

--ignore-builtin-relations
    Now ignored, former usage: When reading OSM files, skip the built-in
    processing of relations. This speeds up the processing non-routable map
    layers that do not contain multipolygons. This implies
    --ignore-turn-restrictions.

--ignore-turn-restrictions
    When reading OSM files, ignore any "restriction" relations.

--ignore-osm-bounds
    When reading OSM files, ignore any "bounds" elements. With this option
    selected generate-sea sometimes works better, but routing across tiles will
    not work.

--preserve-element-order
    Process the map elements (nodes, ways, relations) in the order in which they
    appear in the OSM input. Without this option, the order in which the elements
    are processed is not defined.

--remove-short-arcs[=MinLength]
    Now ignored, former usage: Merge nodes to remove short arcs that can cause
    routing problems. If MinLength is specified (in metres), arcs shorter than
    that length will be removed. If a length is not specified, only zero-length
    arcs will be removed.

--adjust-turn-headings[=BITMASK]
    Now ignored, former usage: Where possible, ensure that turns off to side
    roads change heading sufficiently so that the GPS believes that a turn is
    required rather than a fork. This also avoids spurious instructions to "keep
    right/left" when the road doesn't actually fork.
    Optional BITMASK (default value 3) allows you to specify which adjustments
    are to be made (where necessary):

    * 1 = increase angle between side road and outgoing main road
    * 2 = increase angle between side road and incoming main road

--cycle-map
    Tells mkgmap that the map is for cyclists. This assumes that different
    vehicles are different kinds of bicycles, e.g. a way with mkgmap:car=yes and
    mkgmap:bicycle=no may be a road that is good for racing bikes, but not for
    other cyclists. This allows to optimise sharp angles at junctions of those
    roads. Don't use with the default style as that is a general style!

--report-similar-arcs
    Issue a warning when more than one arc connects two nodes and the ways that
    the arcs are derived from contain identical points. It doesn't make sense to
    use this option at the same time as using the cycleway creating options.

--report-dead-ends=LEVEL
    Set the dead end road warning level. The value of LEVEL (which defaults to 1
    if this option is not specified) determines those roads to report: 0 = none,
    1 = multiple one-way roads that join together but go nowhere, 2 = individual
    one-way roads that go nowhere.

--road-name-pois[=GarminCode]
    Now ignored, former usage: Generate a POI for each named road. By default,
    the POIs' Garmin type code is 0x640a. If desired, a different type code can
    be specified with this option. This is a workaround for not being able to
    search for roads. 0x2f15: a blue dot in the middle of the road, and if you
    select, or 'hover' over it, the street name appears.

--add-pois-to-lines
    Generate POIs for lines. For each line (must not be closed) POIs are created
    at several points of the line. Each POI is tagged with the same tags like the
    line and additional tags added by mkgmap: mkgmap:line2poi=true and tag
    mkgmap:line2poitype having the following values:

    * start - The first point of the line
    * end - The last point of the line
    * inner - Each point of the line except the first and the last
    * mid - The middle point

--add-pois-to-areas
    Generate a POI for each polygon and multipolygon. The POIs are created after
    the relation style but before the other styles are applied. Each POI is
    tagged with the same tags of the area/multipolygon. Additionally the tag
    mkgmap:area2poi=true is set so that it is possible to use that information in
    the points style file. Artifical polygons created by multipolyon processing
    are not used. The POIs are created at the following positions (first rule
    that applies):

    polygons:
        First rule that applies of

        * the first node tagged with a tag defined by the pois-to-areas-placement
          option
        * the centre point

    multipolygons:
        First rule that applies of

        * the node with role=label
        * the centre point of the biggest area

--pois-to-areas-placement[=taglist]
    A semicolon separated list of tag=value definitions. A POI is placed at the
    first node of the polygon tagged with the first tag/value pair. If none of
    the nodes are tagged with the first tag-value pair the first node tagged with
    the second tag-value pair is used and so on. If none of the tag-value pairs
    matches or the taglist is empty the centre of the polygon is used. It is
    possible to define wildcards for tag values like entrance=*.
    Default: entrance=main;entrance=yes;building=entrance

--precomp-sea=directory|zipfile
    Defines the directory or a zip file that contains precompiled sea tiles. Sea
    files in a zip file must be located in the zip file's root directory or in a
    sub directory sea. When this option is defined all natural=coastline tags
    from the input OSM tiles are removed and the precompiled data is used
    instead. This option can be combined with the generate-sea options
    multipolygon, polygons and land-tag. The coastlinefile option is ignored if
    precomp-sea is set.

--coastlinefile=filename[,filename]
    Defines a comma separated list of files that contain coastline data. The
    coastline data from the input files is removed if this option is set. Files
    must have OSM or PBF fileformat.

--generate-sea[=ValueList]
    Generate sea polygons. ValueList is an optional comma separated list of
    values:

    multipolygon
        generate the sea using a multipolygon (the default behaviour so this
        really doesn't need to be specified).

    polygons | no-mp
        don't generate the sea using a multipolygon - instead, generate a
        background sea polygon plus individual land polygons with tag
        natural=land. This requires a suitable land polygon type to be defined in
        the style file (suggested type is 0x010100) and the polygon must be
        defined in the TYP file as having a higher drawing level than the sea
        polygon type.

    no-sea-sectors
        disable the generation of "sea sectors" when the coastline fails to reach
        the tile's boundary.

    extend-sea-sectors
        same as no-sea-sectors. Additional adds a point so coastline reaches the
        nearest tile boundary.

    land-tag=TAG=VAL
        tag to use for land polygons (default natural=land).

    close-gaps=NUM
        close gaps in coastline that are less than this distance (metres)

    floodblocker
        enable the flood blocker that prevents a flooding of land by checking if
        the sea polygons contain streets (works only with multipolygon
        processing)

    fbgap=NUM
        flood blocker gap in metre (default 40) points that are closer to the sea
        polygon do not block

    fbthres=NUM
        at least so many highway points must be contained in a sea polygon so
        that it may be removed by the flood blocker (default 20)

    fbratio=NUM
        only sea polygons with a higher ratio (highway points * 100000 / polygon
        size) are removed (default 0.5)

    fbdebug
        switches on the debugging of the flood blocker generates GPX files for
        each polygon checked by the flood blocker

--make-poi-index
    Generate the POI index (not yet useful).

--nsis
    Write a .nsi file that can be used with the Nullsoft Scriptable Install
    System (NSIS) to create a Windows Mapsource Installer.

--make-all-cycleways
    Deprecated, use --make-opposite-cycleways instead. Former meaning:

Turn on all of the options that make cycleways.
--make-opposite-cycleways
    Some one-way streets allow bicycle traffic in the reverse direction and this
    option makes a way with the same points as the original that allows bicycle
    traffic (in both directions).

--make-cycleways
    Now ignored, former meaning:

Some streets have a separate cycleway track/lane just for bicycle traffic and
this option makes a way with the same points as the original that allows bicycle
traffic. Also, bicycle traffic is prohibited from using the original way (unless
that way's bicycle access has been defined).
--link-pois-to-ways
    This option may copy some specific attributes of a POI to a small part of the
    way the POI is located on. This can be used to let barriers block a way or to
    lower the calculated speed around traffic signals. POIs with the tags
    highway=* (e.g. highway=traffic_signals) or barrier=* (e.g.
    barrier=cycle_barrier) are supported. The style developer must add at least
    one of the access tags (mkgmap:foot, mkgmap:car etc.), mkgmap:road-speed
    and/or mkgmap:road-class to the POI. The access tags are ignored if they have
    no effect for the way, else a route restriction is added at the POI so that
    only allowed vehicles are routed through it. The tags mkgmap:road-speed
    and/or mkgmap:road-class are applied to a small part of the way around the
    POI, typically to the next junction or a length of ~25 m. The tags are
    ignored for pedestrian-only ways.

--process-destination
    Splits all motorway_link, trunk_link, primary_link, secondary_link, and
    tertiary_link ways tagged with destination into two or three parts where the
    second part is additionally tagged with mkgmap:dest_hint=*. The code checks
    for the tags destination, destination:lanes, destination:street and some
    variants with :forward/:backward like destination:forward or
    destination:lanes:backward. If a value for destination is found, the special
    tag mkgmap:dest_hint is set to it and the way is split. This happens before
    the style rules are processed. This allows to use any routable Garmin type
    (except 0x08 and 0x09) for that part so that the Garmin device tells the name
    of this part as hint which destination to follow. See also --process-exits.

--process-exits
    Usual Garmin devices do not tell the name of the exit on motorways while
    routing with mkgmap created maps. This option splits each motorway_link,
    trunk_link, primary_link, secondary_link, and tertiary_link way into three
    parts. All parts are tagged with the original tags of the link. Additionally
    the middle part is tagged with the following tags:
    
      mkgmap:exit_hint=true
      mkgmap:exit_hint_ref=<ref tag value of the exit>
      mkgmap:exit_hint_name=<name tag value of the exit>
      mkgmap:exit_hint_exit_to=<exit_to tag value of the exit>

    Adding a rule checking the mkgmap:exit_hint=true makes it possible to use any
    routable Garmin type (except 0x08 and 0x09) for the middle part so that the
    Garmin device tells the name of this middle part as hint where to leave the
    motorway/trunk. The first part must have type 0x08 or 0x09 so that Garmin
    uses the hint.

--delete-tags-file=FILENAME
    Names a file that should contain one or more lines of the form TAG=VALUE or
    TAG=*. Blank lines and lines that start with a # or ; are ignored. All
    tag/value pairs in the OSM input are compared with these patterns and those
    that match are deleted.

--tdbfile
    Write files that are essential to running with MapSource, a .tdb file and an
    overview map.

--show-profiles=1
    Sets a flag in tdb file which marks set mapset as having contour lines and
    allows showing profile in MapSource. Default is 0 which means disabled.

--draw-priority=25
    When two maps cover the same area, this option controls what order they are
    drawn in and therefore which map is on top of which. Higher priorities are
    drawn "on top" of lower priorities.

--transparent
    Make the map transparent, so that if two maps are loaded that cover the same
    area, you can see through this map and see the lower map too. Useful for
    contour line maps among other things.

--poi-address
    Enable address / phone information to POIs. Address info is read according to
    the "Karlsruhe" tagging schema. Automatic filling of missing information
    could be enabled using the "location-autofill" option. Default is enabled,
    use --no-poi-address to disable.

--verbose
    Makes some operations more verbose. Mostly used with --list-styles.
