The mkgmap TYP file compiler
============================
This document describes the format that is understood by the mkgmap TYP compiler.
It contains everything you need to write a TYP file description that can be
compiled, showing exactly how you can get the different colour effects that are
available.

Although you can edit these files by hand, it is very much more convenient to use
one of the graphical editors that are available.

These produce file formats that differ from each other and have variations to the
specification that is presented here. These variations will be supported as they
are discovered as long as they do not conflict with each other, but are not
listed here for clarity. In particular the files produced by TYPWiz[1] and
TYPViewer[2] are supported.

The [_id] section
=================

FID=#
    The family id.

ProductCode=#
    The product code within a family, usually just left as one.

CodePage=#
    The code page to use for writing the labels.

Example:

[_id]
FID=1299
ProductCode=1
CodePage=1252
[end]

The [_drawOrder] section
========================
This is a list of polygon types and level numbers. Polygons with a higher level
number are drawn on top of those with a lower one.

There is only one tag that is valid in this section.

Type=object_type,level
    The object_type is the polygon type such as 0x07 or an extended type such as
    0x10208

    The level is a number starting at 1.

Example:


[_drawOrder]
Type=0x032,1
Type=0x10101,2
Type=0x002,3
Type=0x003,3
Type=0x007,3
Type=0x009,3
Type=0x00c,3
Type=0x00e,3
Type=0x010,3
Type=0x012,3
Type=0x015,3
Type=0x01b,3
...
[end]

If a polygon type is not listed in this section, then it will not be displayed at
all. If it is then it will be styled according to a definition in a [_polygon]
section later in this file, or in the default Garmin style if these is no such
definition.

Element sections
================
The main part of the file consists of descriptions of how elements are to be
displayed so that you can change the colours and style of the displayed elements.

Each style definition starts with the name of the section in square brackets and
ends with the line "[end]". For example:

[_polygon]
Type=0x02
String1=0x04,Residential
String2=0x01,RÃ©sidentiel
String3=0x03,Bebouwde kom
ExtendedLabels=Y
FontStyle=NoLabel
Xpm="0 0 2 0"
"! c #DCDCDC"
" c none"
[end]

[_line]
Type=0x22
; options to style the line
[end]

[_point]
Type=0x52
; options to style the POI
[end]

You have one of these for each polygon, line of POI you want to change from the
built in Garmin style.

Common options for element sections
===================================
These options will work in all the element sections [_point], [_line] and
[_polygon].

Type=object_type
    The object type number - the kind of element that it is. If the number is
    greater than 0xff then it will be treated as a type and subtype combination.
    Eg 0x2305 is type 0x23 with subtype 0x5.

String=#,xxx
    Defines a label that will be attached to the element. The first part is a
    language number, the second the actual string. You can use String1, String2
    for compatibility, but just String will do for the mkgmap compiler.
     String=0x04,Parking
     String=0x03,Parkeerplaats

FontStyle=xxx
    xxx can be one of NoLabel, SmallFont, NormalFont, LargeFont.

DayCustomColor=#colour
    The colour used for the font when the GPS unit is displaying day colours.

NightCustomColor=#colour
    The colour used when the GPS unit is displaying night colours.

XPM format
==========
The XPM format is a fairly widely used format for small image icons, so you can
read about it elsewhere[3]. You would normally use some tool to create the image
and copy it in, but it is possible to create them by hand. This is a brief
summary of what it all means based on the following example:
--
[3] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_PixMap

Xpm="10 5 3 1"
"r c #ff0000"
"g c #00ff00"
"b c #0000ff"
"rrrrrrrrrr"
"rrrrrrrrrr"
"rbbbbbgggr"
"rbbbrggggr"
"rbbrrrrrrr"
"rrrrrrrrrr"

Working from the top, the first line consists of four numbers that mean in order:
the pixmap has a width of 10 and a height of 5; there are 3 different colours and
each colour is represented by 1 character.

There then follows the three lines giving the colours to use. The first
character(s) are a short name for the colour, in this case there is one character
(r, g, b) because the last field in the first line was 1. Next is the letter 'c'
which can be ignored, and the follows the normal RGB representation of the
colour. In this case I have chosen red to be represented by the letter r, g for
green and b for blue, but you can use any characters or colours you choose. A
space is allowed, and it is traditional to use a space for the background colour.

Then there is the pixmap itself, it is 10 columns wide and 5 lines to match the
width and height values in the first line. If the number of characters
representing each pixel was 2 say, then there would be 10 groups of 2 characters
across. Each letter represents one pixel of the final image, in this example, the
top of the icon would be a red line and in the middle there would be some blue
and green.

Polygon elements
================
A [_polygon] section can have any of the common tags.

It must also contain an Xpm tag. This uses a modified form of the XPM format, see
the XPM section for details about the format that are common between all the
element types. The following notes only refer to how it is used within the
polygon section.

* A single solid colour, that is the same in day and night displays
  Xpm="0 0 1 0"
  "a c #778899"

* One solid colour that is used in the day display mode and another that is used
  in the night display mode.
  Xpm="0 0 2 0"
  "a c #778899"
  "b c #223322"

* A pixmap that has the same solid colours in day and night modes. The pixmap
  must be 32x32 and have two colours.
  Xpm="32 32 2 1"
  "a c #778899"
  "b c #223322"
  "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
  "aaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbaaaaaaaaaaaa"
  "aaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbaaaaaaaaaa"
  ; ... 32 rows in total

* The pixmap can have a transparent background, in which case the second colour
  will be given as 'none'
  Xpm="32 32 2 1"
  "a c #778899"
  "b c none"
  "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
  "aaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbaaaaaaaaaaaa"
  "aaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbaaaaaaaaaa"
  ; ... 32 rows in total

* If you want to have different colours for the day and night modes, then use 4
  colours. As before the second and fourth colours can be 'none' to indicate that
  the background is transparent for the day and/or night colour respectively. In
  the example the night colour has a transparent background and the day version
  does not. When you draw the pixmap you only use the day colours, the device
  will automatically switch to the alternate colours when in night mode. It is
  traditional to use '3' and '4' for the night colour tags in the XPM, but with
  mkgmap you can use whatever you like.
  Xpm="32 32 4 1"
  "a c #778899"
  "b c #221133"
  "3 c #112233"
  "4 c none"
  "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
  "aaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbaaaaaaaaaaaa"
  "aaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbaaaaaaaaaa"
  ; ... 32 rows in total

Line elements
=============
A line section can contain any of the common tags. It can also have the following
additional tags

LineWidth=#
    The line width in pixels. This is the width, excluding borders if there are
    any. This is only used if there is not a pixmap.

BorderWidth=#
    The border width. The line will be drawn (on devices that support this) with
    a border at each edge of the line. It is only used if there is no pixmap. If
    there should not be a border then it can be omitted or set to zero.

UseOrientation=(Y|N)
    If Y then the pixmap is rotated so that is always following the direction of
    the road.
    LineWidth=2
    BorderWidth=2
    UseOrientation=Y

As with polygons there is an Xpm tag too and it can specify that solid colours
should be used or that there is a bitmap.

If there is a bitmap then it is always has a width of 32, its height w
