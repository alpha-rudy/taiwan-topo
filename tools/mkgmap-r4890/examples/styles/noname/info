summary: Special map to highlight roads with no name

description {
	This style is to help find roads that don't yet have a name in OSM
	by highlighting those roads.  Roads that have a name or a ref
	are shown as thin lines, ones that are missing a name are shown
	as thick lines.

	If there is a noname=yes tag this means that the road really doesn't have
	a name and so they won't be highlighted.
}
